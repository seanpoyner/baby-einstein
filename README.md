# Baby Einstein  
**Building an AI through Childhood Brain Development**

The purpose of this project is to develop a "conscious" & "thinking" AI framework, which we will hereon refer to as albert, that resembles our only other known form of consciousness: the human mind.

Our goal is to create a program that operates like the human brain by enforcing the following traits in albert:

1. **Ego:**  
   We incorporate an 'ego' into albert through the following methods:  
   - **Blank Slate Initialization:**  
     Albert starts without pre-loaded memories or highly tuned skills. Instead, he begins with a set of basic 'schemas' inspired by common areas of the human brain.  
   - **Inner Monologue:**  
     Albert engages in self-talk and introspection while interacting with the environment and during idle moments. He contemplates, imagines, and daydreams, allowing for rich internal processing.  
   - **Dynamic Memory & Storage:**  
     Albert is given limited memory capacity that fades or updates over time. Memories and stored experiences are influenced by recency and reinforcement (both external and self-reinforced), ensuring a unique, time-dependent ego.

2. **Identity:**  
   While the ego can fluctuate moment to moment, identity provides continuity over time. Albert’s identity is formed and refined through long-term reinforcement, self-reflection, and ambition. Updates to his identity occur during designated sleep cycles and growth phases, leading to gradual yet meaningful changes.

3. **Ambition/Purpose:**  
   Albert is imbued with fundamental ambitions that evolve through his experiences:  
   - **Learn:**  
     Gain knowledge of the world from continuous experiences and self-reflection.  
   - **Improve:**  
     Learn efficiently under limited resources.  
   - **Grow:**  
     Undergo periodic growth stages that involve resource allocations at testing points—evaluating novel problem solving and developing what we might call "emotional maturity."

## Overview of the Current Implementation

So far, we have laid the foundations for albert by developing two essential modules which mimic key brain functions:

### 1. Chat Engine (Ego & Internal Dialogue)  
The Chat Engine serves as albert’s internal dialogue system, allowing him to generate responses that mirror the mind’s inner monologue. This module utilizes modern transformer-based architectures (e.g., distilgpt2) to simulate conversation and reasoning. Key features include:

- **Prompt Construction:**  
  Combining system prompts (which mimic different functional brain regions like the thalamus and anterior cingulate cortex) with user messages.
  
- **Reply Generation:**  
  Producing coherent, context-aware replies, which emulate thought processes based on the structured "brain schemas" from our system prompt.

### 2. Sight Engine (Sensory Processing)  
The Sight Engine mimics visual perception. By leveraging vision transformer models and image captioning techniques, it processes image inputs similarly to how the visual cortex interprets visual information. Key features include:

- **Image Preprocessing:**  
  Resizing and standardizing images (with libraries like Pillow and ViTImageProcessor) before feeding them to the model.
  
- **Description Generation:**  
  Generating compact descriptions that serve as albert’s "perception" of visual stimuli.

## How to Get Started

1. **Installation:**  
   Run the provided install script to set up the environment:  
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```
   Alternatively, install Python libraries manually using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Running the Application:**  
   Launch the FastAPI server from the `albert` directory:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
   The endpoints are as follows:
   - **/chat/completions:** Processes text-based interactions, simulating internal dialogue.
   - **/sight/:** Processes image inputs and returns a visual description.

3. **Testing & Debugging:**  
   Utilize the `debug.py` script or the Jupyter Notebook (`notebook.ipynb`) for local tests and experimental modifications.

## Future Work

- **Dynamic Memory & Identity Updates:**  
  Develop algorithms that simulate memory chastening, recency effects, and reinforcement-based identity updates.
  
- **Enhanced Sensory Integration:**  
  Integrate additional sensory modules (e.g., auditory or tactile perception) to further enrich albert's conscious experience.
  
- **Growth Stages:**  
  Establish periodic “sleep cycles” and testing phases that facilitate the evolution of albert’s identity, learning, and overall cognitive capabilities.
  
- **Ethical Frameworks:**  
  Ensure that albert’s evolution remains ethically guided while exploring autonomous behavior and decision-making.
